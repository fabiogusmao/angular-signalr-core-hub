# Installation

## Bower

    npm install angular-signalr-core-hubs


# Frequently Asked Questions

## Is this a fork of [angular-signalr-hubs](https://github.com/JustMaier/angular-signalr-hub)?

No. This is inspired by `angular-signalr-hubs` in order to make thins easier for people who used it in the past and want to migrate to the new [ASP.NET Core SignalR Client SDK](https://github.com/aspnet/SignalR/tree/dev/client-ts).

## The new ASP.NET Core SignalR SDK does not provide a Bower package. Does this package include it?

Yes. This may be dropped in future releases if the ASP.NET Core team provides this kind of package.

**Note**: We will be publishing releases with our version numbers matching the Client SDK's for the time being so that it is easy for developers to understand what version of the SDK is being used.
