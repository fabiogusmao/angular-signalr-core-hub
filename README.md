# Installation

## Bower

    npm install angular-signalr-core-hubs


# Frequently Asked Questions

## Is this a fork of [angular-signalr-hubs](https://github.com/JustMaier/angular-signalr-hub)?

No. This is inspired by `angular-signalr-hubs` in order to make thins easier for people who used it in the past and want to migrate to the new [ASP.NET Core SignalR Client SDK](https://github.com/aspnet/SignalR/tree/dev/client-ts).

## The new ASP.NET Core SignalR SDK does not provide a Bower package. Does this package include it?

Yes. This may be dropped in future releases if the ASP.NET Core team provides this kind of package.
